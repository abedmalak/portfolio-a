            It all started when my grandmother asked me to solve a problem she had with her phone;
            I had no clue what was wrong with that thing, whenever I would tap on an app or try to
            load a website, all I would see was white. Fast forward to today, I now develop the very software
            that she uses, using the latest technologies. The problem she had with her phone was that her wifi was turned off.
